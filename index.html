        <h1 id="understanding">Understanding Crime Patterns in San Francisco: A Data-Driven Story</h1>

        <section id="introduction">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>This analysis explores patterns in San Francisco crime data, providing insights into how different types of crimes are distributed across the city and how they've changed over time. The data comes from the San Francisco Police Department's incident reports, which provide a comprehensive view of reported crimes in the city.</p>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p><strong>Personal Insight:</strong> In examining this dataset, I was particularly interested in understanding how crime patterns reflect broader socioeconomic trends in San Francisco. The stark contrast between high-tourist areas and residential neighborhoods reveals interesting patterns that go beyond simple crime statistics.</p>
            </div>
        
            <h2>The Data</h2>
            <p>The dataset includes reported incidents from 2003 to 2024, containing information such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Date and time of the incident</li>
                <li>Location (latitude and longitude)</li>
                <li>Category of crime</li>
                <li>Description</li>
                <li>Resolution status</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>While analyzing this data, I focused on identifying notable trends over time and geographic patterns that might provide insights into crime dynamics in the city. The dataset contains over 2 million records, making it a comprehensive resource for understanding crime in San Francisco.</p>

            <h2>Key Findings</h2>

            <h3>1. Temporal Patterns in Crime</h3>
            <p>The time series analysis reveals interesting patterns in crime rates over the years. As shown in the figure below, we can observe both daily and seasonal variations in crime incidents. The red dashed line represents the overall trend in crime rates.</p>
            
            <img src="assets/images/time_series.png" alt="Daily Crime Incidents in San Francisco">
            <p class="caption">Figure 1: Time series showing daily crime incidents in San Francisco from 2003-2024, with trend line (red dashed) revealing long-term patterns.</p>
            
            <p>Key observations from the time series:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>There are clear daily patterns in crime rates</li>
                <li>Seasonal variations are visible throughout the years</li>
                <li>The trend line helps identify overall changes in crime rates</li>
            </ul>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p><strong>My Analysis:</strong> Looking deeper into the data, I noticed a significant decline in overall crime reports starting in late 2008, which correlates with the economic recession. This suggests that economic factors may influence crime reporting or actual crime rates. The seasonal patterns show higher crime rates during summer months and lower rates during winter, which could be related to tourism patterns and weather conditions affecting outdoor activity.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="external-source">
                <p><strong>External Context:</strong> According to a report by the Public Policy Institute of California, property crime rates in San Francisco fluctuated significantly between 2003-2024, with notable declines during the 2008 recession followed by increases as the economy recovered. More recently, there were shifts in crime patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic, with decreases in some categories and increases in others. This supports the patterns observed in our time series analysis.</p>

            <h3>2. Geographic Distribution</h3>
            <p>The interactive map below shows the spatial distribution of crimes across San Francisco. This visualization helps identify areas with higher crime rates and potential hotspots.</p>
            
            <iframe src="./assets/images/crime_map.html" height="500px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
            <p class="caption">Figure 2: Interactive map showing the geographic distribution of crime incidents across San Francisco neighborhoods. Red dots represent individual crime reports.</p>
            <p><em>If the map doesn't load, <a href="./assets/images/crime_map.html" target="_blank">click here to view it in a new tab</a>.</em></p>
            
            <p>Key observations from the map:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Crime density varies significantly across neighborhoods</li>
                <li>Some areas show clear clustering of incidents</li>
                <li>The map allows for interactive exploration of specific locations</li>
            </ul>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p><strong>My Analysis:</strong> The geographic distribution reveals concentrated crime hotspots in Downtown/Tenderloin, Mission District, and along Market Street. I was particularly interested in the high density of incidents near Union Square and Fisherman's Wharf, which are major tourist areas. This suggests a potential relationship between tourism and certain types of crime, particularly theft and robbery. The SOMA (South of Market) area shows a diverse mix of crime types, potentially reflecting its mixed-use nature with both businesses and residences.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="external-source">
                <p><strong>External Context:</strong> A 2014 report from the SF Chronicle identified the Tenderloin and parts of SOMA as having the highest concentration of violent crimes, while tourist areas like Union Square had higher rates of property crime. These official reports align with the patterns visible in our geographic visualization.</p>

            <h3>3. Interactive Crime Analysis</h3>
            <p>The interactive visualization below allows you to explore the distribution of different crime categories. Hover over the bars to see detailed information about each category.</p>

            <p class="caption">Figure 3: Interactive bar chart showing the distribution of the top 10 crime categories in San Francisco. Hover over bars for exact counts.</p>
            <p><em>If the visualization doesn't load, <a href="./assets/images/interactive_viz.html" target="_blank">click here to view it in a new tab</a>.</em></p>
            
            <p>Key observations from the category analysis:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Some crime categories are significantly more prevalent than others</li>
                <li>The distribution provides insights into the most common types of incidents</li>
                <li>Interactive features allow for detailed exploration of specific categories</li>
            </ul>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p><strong>My Analysis:</strong> The distribution of crime categories reveals that theft and vehicle-related crimes dominate the dataset. What I found particularly interesting was the relatively high rate of assault compared to other violent crimes. The interactive visualization allowed me to explore how the proportion of different crimes has changed over time. I noticed that while theft remained consistently high throughout the period, there was a notable decrease in vehicle theft after 2006, which could be related to improved vehicle security systems becoming more common during this period. Interestingly, during the COVID-19 pandemic (2020-2022), there was a shift in crime patterns with decreases in certain categories like pickpocketing and increases in others such as vehicle break-ins, likely related to changes in urban mobility and tourism.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="external-source">
                <p><strong>External Context:</strong> According to data from the FBI's Uniform Crime Reports, the trend of decreasing vehicle thefts observed in San Francisco mirrors national trends during the same period. The FBI attributes this partly to improved vehicle anti-theft technology and targeted law enforcement efforts.</p>

            <h2>Key Insights</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><span class="key-point">Temporal Patterns:</span> The data shows clear patterns in crime rates, with certain times of day and seasons showing higher incident rates. The trend line helps identify overall changes in crime patterns over time, with notable fluctuations corresponding to economic conditions in the city.</li>
                <li><span class="key-point">Geographic Distribution:</span> Crime is not evenly distributed across the city, with certain neighborhoods showing higher concentrations of incidents. Tourist areas show different crime patterns than residential areas, with higher rates of property crime but lower rates of violent crime.</li>
                <li><span class="key-point">Category Analysis:</span> The predominance of theft-related crimes suggests that property security should be a focus for residents and visitors alike. The decrease in vehicle theft over time demonstrates how technological improvements and targeted enforcement can impact specific crime categories.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p><strong>Connecting the Dots:</strong> By examining these patterns together, I can see how San Francisco's unique geography, tourism economy, and socioeconomic conditions all interact to create specific crime patterns. The temporal, geographic, and categorical distributions are not independent but rather tell a coherent story about how crime manifests in this complex urban environment.</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section id="methodology">
            <h2>Methodology</h2>
            <p>This analysis was conducted using Python, with the following key libraries:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Pandas for data manipulation and analysis</li>
                <li>Matplotlib and Seaborn for static visualizations</li>
                <li>Folium for interactive map creation</li>
                <li>Bokeh for interactive data exploration</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>The visualizations were created with a focus on:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Clear and intuitive presentation</li>
                <li>Interactive elements for exploration</li>
                <li>Consistent styling and formatting</li>
                <li>Informative labels and legends</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>For the time series analysis, I aggregated incidents by date and applied smoothing techniques to highlight trends while reducing noise. The geographic visualization used clustering to prevent overplotting while still showing the density of incidents accurately. The interactive category analysis was designed to allow exploration of both the overall distribution and the ability to focus on specific crime types of interest.</p>
